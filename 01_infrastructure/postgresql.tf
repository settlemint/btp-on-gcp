# POSTGRESQL DATABASE DEPLOYMENT AND CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================
# 
# Deploys and configures PostgreSQL, a powerful, open-source relational
# database system that serves as the primary data store for the BTP platform.
# PostgreSQL provides ACID compliance, advanced indexing, and comprehensive
# SQL support required for blockchain application data management.
# 
# POSTGRESQL OVERVIEW:
# PostgreSQL is chosen for the BTP platform due to its:
# - ACID compliance ensuring data consistency and reliability
# - Advanced indexing capabilities for high-performance queries
# - JSON and JSONB support for flexible blockchain data storage
# - Extensive ecosystem of extensions and tools
# - Enterprise-grade security features and access controls
# - Proven scalability for high-transaction blockchain applications
# 
# BTP PLATFORM INTEGRATION:
# In the BTP deployment, PostgreSQL serves critical functions:
# - User account and authentication data storage
# - Blockchain network configuration and metadata
# - Transaction history and audit logging
# - Application state and configuration management
# - Smart contract deployment tracking
# - Analytics and reporting data aggregation
# 
# ENTERPRISE FEATURES:
# - High availability through Kubernetes persistent volumes
# - Automated backup and recovery capabilities
# - Connection pooling for optimal resource utilization
# - Monitoring and alerting integration
# - Security hardening with role-based access control
# - Performance tuning for blockchain workload patterns
#

# PostgreSQL Database Password Generation
# Generates a cryptographically secure random password for PostgreSQL
# database authentication. This password is used for both the application
# user and the PostgreSQL superuser (postgres) account.
# 
# PASSWORD SECURITY:
# - 16-character length provides strong security against brute force attacks
# - Excludes special characters to avoid shell escaping and configuration issues
# - Uses cryptographically secure random generation
# - Automatically managed by Terraform state for consistency
# 
# CREDENTIAL MANAGEMENT:
# - Password is stored in Terraform state (consider remote state encryption)
# - Used by BTP applications for database connectivity
# - Can be rotated by updating Terraform configuration
# - Should be backed up as part of disaster recovery procedures

}

# PostgreSQL Helm Release
# Deploys PostgreSQL using the official Bitnami Helm chart, which provides
# a production-ready database deployment with comprehensive configuration
# options, monitoring, and operational features.
# 
# BITNAMI CHART FEATURES:
# - Production-ready PostgreSQL configuration
# - Integrated backup and recovery mechanisms
# - Comprehensive monitoring and metrics collection
# - Security hardening and access controls
# - Persistent storage integration with Kubernetes
# - High availability and clustering support (when configured)
# 
# DEPLOYMENT ARCHITECTURE:
# - Single-instance deployment suitable for development and small production
# - Persistent volume for data durability across pod restarts
# - Service exposure for internal cluster communication
# - ConfigMap and Secret management for configuration
# - Integration with Kubernetes RBAC and security policies
