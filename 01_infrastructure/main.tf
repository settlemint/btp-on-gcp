# ============================================================================
# CORE INFRASTRUCTURE MODULE - MAIN CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================
# 
# This file contains the core infrastructure components for SettleMint's
# Blockchain Transformation Platform (BTP) on Google Cloud Platform.
# It orchestrates the deployment of:
# 
# 1. GOOGLE KUBERNETES ENGINE (GKE): Production-ready Kubernetes cluster
# 2. KUBERNETES NAMESPACES: Logical separation of platform components
# 3. WORKLOAD IDENTITY: Secure GCP-to-Kubernetes authentication
# 4. KEY MANAGEMENT SERVICE: Encryption keys for Vault auto-unsealing
# 
# ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW:
# The infrastructure follows enterprise-grade patterns with:
# - Regional GKE deployment for high availability
# - Workload Identity for secure cloud resource access
# - Managed node pools with auto-scaling capabilities
# - Integrated security controls and monitoring
# - KMS-based encryption for secrets management
# 
# DEPLOYMENT DEPENDENCIES:
# This module requires:
# - DNS zone module (00_dns_zone) to be deployed first
# - Google Cloud APIs enabled: GKE, IAM, KMS, DNS
# - Appropriate IAM permissions for Terraform service account
# - Network infrastructure (uses default VPC by default)
# 
# ENTERPRISE CONSIDERATIONS:
# - Cluster configuration optimized for blockchain workloads
# - Multi-zone deployment for fault tolerance
# - Scalable node pools for varying computational demands
# - Security hardening with Shielded GKE nodes
# - Cost optimization through efficient resource allocation
# 
# ============================================================================

# Google Cloud Client Configuration Data Source
# Retrieves the current Google Cloud authentication context and configuration.
# This data source provides access to the current user's or service account's
# authentication token, which is essential for configuring Kubernetes and
# Helm providers to communicate with the GKE cluster.
# 
# AUTHENTICATION FLOW:
# 1. Terraform authenticates to Google Cloud using configured credentials
# 2. This data source captures the current authentication context
# 3. The access token is used by Kubernetes/Helm providers for cluster access
# 4. Tokens are automatically refreshed as needed during deployment
# 
# SECURITY IMPLICATIONS:
# - Tokens are temporary and automatically rotated
# - No static credentials are stored or exposed
# - Authentication inherits from Terraform's GCP configuration
# - Supports both user accounts and service account authentication
data "google_client_config" "default" {}

# Platform Unique Identifier Generator
# Generates a cryptographically secure random identifier used as a suffix
# for various resources to ensure uniqueness across deployments and prevent
# naming conflicts in shared GCP projects or multi-environment setups.
# 
# USAGE ACROSS INFRASTRUCTURE:
# - GKE cluster names: "${var.gcp_platform_name}-${random_id.platform_suffix.hex}"
# - Service account names: "${service_name}-${random_id.platform_suffix.hex}"
# - KMS key ring names: "${var.gcp_key_ring_name}-${random_id.platform_suffix.hex}"
# - Workload identity bindings: Ensures unique identity mappings
# 
# BENEFITS:
# - Prevents resource name collisions in shared environments
# - Enables multiple BTP deployments in the same GCP project
# - Provides unique identifiers for disaster recovery scenarios
# - Supports blue-green deployment strategies
# 
# SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
# - Uses cryptographically secure random generation
# - 4-byte length provides 4.3 billion unique combinations
# - Hex encoding ensures compatibility with GCP naming requirements
# - Persistent across Terraform state for consistent naming

# ============================================================================
# WORKLOAD IDENTITY CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================
# 
# Configures Google Cloud Workload Identity to enable secure authentication
# between Kubernetes pods and Google Cloud services without storing static
# service account keys. This approach provides:
# - Enhanced security through temporary, scoped credentials
# - Automatic credential rotation and management
# - Fine-grained IAM role assignment per service
# - Elimination of static credential management overhead
# 
# WORKLOAD IDENTITY ARCHITECTURE:
# 1. Google Service Account: Created in GCP with specific IAM roles
# 2. Kubernetes Service Account: Created in target namespace
# 3. IAM Policy Binding: Links GSA and KSA for secure authentication
# 4. Pod Authentication: Pods use KSA to obtain GSA credentials
# 
# SECURITY BENEFITS:
# - No static credentials stored in cluster or containers
# - Automatic token refresh and short-lived credentials
# - Principle of least privilege through role-specific access
# - Audit trail of all service account operations
# ============================================================================

# Cert-Manager Workload Identity

# SSL certificate provisioning. This workload identity provides cert-manager
# with the necessary permissions to create and manage DNS TXT records for
# domain validation during certificate issuance.

# - Temporary credentials with automatic rotation
# - Activity logged in Google Cloud Audit Logs
# - Namespace isolation limits blast radius
