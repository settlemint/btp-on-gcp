# REDIS CACHE DEPLOYMENT AND CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================
# 
# Deploys and configures Redis, a high-performance in-memory data structure
# store that serves as the primary caching and session storage solution for
# the BTP platform. Redis provides sub-millisecond response times and
# advanced data structures essential for blockchain application performance.
# 
# REDIS OVERVIEW:
# Redis is chosen for the BTP platform due to its:
# - Exceptional performance with sub-millisecond response times
# - Rich data structures (strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets)
# - Built-in pub/sub messaging for real-time blockchain event handling
# - Atomic operations ensuring data consistency in concurrent environments
# - Lua scripting support for complex blockchain data processing
# - Persistence options for durability and disaster recovery
# 
# BTP PLATFORM INTEGRATION:
# In the BTP deployment, Redis serves critical functions:
# - Session storage for user authentication and state management
# - Caching of frequently accessed blockchain data and metadata
# - Real-time event streaming for blockchain transaction notifications
# - Rate limiting and throttling for API endpoints
# - Temporary storage for blockchain node synchronization data
# - Message queuing for asynchronous blockchain operations
# 
# ENTERPRISE FEATURES:
# - High availability through master-replica configurations (when configured)
# - Automatic failover and cluster management capabilities
# - Comprehensive monitoring and alerting integration
# - Security hardening with authentication and encryption
# - Backup and restore mechanisms for data protection
# - Performance optimization for blockchain workload patterns
#

# Redis Authentication Password Generation
# Generates a cryptographically secure random password for Redis
# authentication. This password protects the Redis instance from
# unauthorized access and ensures secure communication between
# BTP applications and the Redis service.
# 
# PASSWORD SECURITY:
# - 16-character length provides strong security against brute force attacks
# - Excludes special characters to avoid configuration and client library issues
# - Uses cryptographically secure random generation
# - Automatically managed by Terraform state for consistency
# 
# CREDENTIAL MANAGEMENT:
# - Password is used by all BTP applications for Redis connectivity
# - Stored in Kubernetes secrets for secure access
# - Can be rotated by updating Terraform configuration
# - Should be included in disaster recovery backup procedures
resource "random_password" "redis_password" {

}

# Redis Helm Release
# Deploys Redis using the official Bitnami Helm chart, which provides
# a production-ready Redis deployment with comprehensive configuration
# options, monitoring, and operational features.
# 
# BITNAMI CHART FEATURES:
# - Production-ready Redis configuration with security hardening
# - Multiple deployment architectures (standalone, master-replica, cluster)
# - Integrated monitoring and metrics collection
# - Persistent storage options for data durability
# - Comprehensive backup and recovery mechanisms
# - Security features including TLS encryption and authentication
# 
# DEPLOYMENT ARCHITECTURE:
# - Standalone deployment suitable for development and small production
# - Single Redis instance with persistent storage
# - Service exposure for internal cluster communication
# - ConfigMap and Secret management for configuration
# - Integration with Kubernetes resource management and scaling
